Should be all good to go.

There are obsolete csv write-files.  these are a relic from trying to get the txt files.  I accidentally discovered reading to txt by omitting the .csv, but still using the csv function to write.

I did use a lot of advice from chatGPT, but only to understand functions and to understand programming grammar and proper parantheses to use etc.

i have an updated compiled excel file of commands to use and their descriptions that I am now using as reference.
